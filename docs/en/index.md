## Why MANYOYO

MANYOYO is focused on one thing: safe and efficient agent CLI execution.

- Keep your host clean while running high-privilege agent workflows
- Switch between Agent CLI and `/bin/bash` inside the same sandbox session
- Reuse configuration and environment templates across projects

For complete details, see the repository `README.md` and `docs/README_EN.md`.
